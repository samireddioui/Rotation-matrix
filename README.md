# Rotation-matrix
In the theory of three-dimensional rotation, Rodrigues' rotation formula, named after Olinde Rodrigues, is an efficient algorithm for rotating a vector in space, given an axis and angle of rotation
To find the rotation matrix for your robot, this function was done in order to help you in this all you need to do is input your axis of rotation and the angle theta.
